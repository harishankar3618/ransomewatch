# Signature-based Ransomware Detection Tool

## Overview
This project is a **Signature-based Ransomware Detection Tool** designed to identify ransomware threats using custom **YARA rules**. By analyzing ransomware characteristics and behaviors, the tool provides an efficient way to detect known ransomware families, enhancing system security and reducing potential damage.

## Features
- **YARA Rule Integration**: Detect ransomware through signature-based matching.
- **File Scanning**: Analyze files and directories for potential ransomware patterns.
- **Memory Dump Scanning**: Inspect system memory to identify active threats.
- **Customizable Rules**: Extend detection capabilities by adding or modifying YARA rules.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance in both local and enterprise environments.

## How It Works
1. **YARA Rule Development**:
   - Custom YARA rules were crafted by analyzing ransomware samples and identifying unique patterns, file structures, and behaviors.
   
2. **Detection Mechanism**:
   - The tool scans files, memory, or system processes and matches them against predefined YARA rules.
   - Alerts are generated when a match is found, enabling early threat detection.

3. **Execution Workflow**:
   - Input the file or directory path to scan.
   - Load and apply YARA rules to the target.
   - Display the results, including any matched ransomware signatures.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ransomware-detection.git
   cd ransomware-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install yara-python
   ```

3. (Optional) Test YARA installation:
   ```bash
   python -m yara --version
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Scanner**:
   ```bash
   python detect_ransomware.py --path <file_or_directory_path> --rules <yara_rules_file>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python detect_ransomware.py --path /path/to/scan --rules ransomware_rules.yar
   ```

2. **Add New YARA Rules**:
   - Place new `.yar` files in the `rules/` directory.
   - Ensure the syntax follows YARA conventions.

3. **View Results**:
   - Matched signatures will be displayed in the console or saved to a log file.

## Example YARA Rule
```yara
rule RansomwareExample
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects Example Ransomware"
        author = "Your Name"
        date = "2025-01-07"

    strings:
        $ransom_ext = ".locked"
        $ransom_note = "Your files have been encrypted!"
        $suspicious_string = { 6D 61 6C 77 61 72 65 2D 70 61 74 74 65 72 6E }

    condition:
        any of them
}
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `yara-python` module

Install requirements using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Limitations
- **Known Threats Only**: This tool relies on YARA rules and may not detect unknown ransomware.
- **False Positives**: Some benign files may match YARA rules due to similar patterns.
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Not included; future updates may add heuristic-based detection.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding heuristic and behavioral analysis.
- Integrating real-time monitoring capabilities.
- Extending rule sets for broader detection coverage.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or want to improve YARA rules, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
